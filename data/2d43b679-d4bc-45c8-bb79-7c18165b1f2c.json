When the new Superintelligence Lab launched, testing on the model reportedly halted.\nThe discussions are just that — discussions. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg would still need to sign off on any changes, and a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that Meta’s position on open source AI is “unchanged.”\n“We plan to continue releasing leading open source models,” the spokesperson said. “We haven’t released everything we’ve developed historically and we expect to continue training a mix of open and closed models going forward.”\nThe spokesperson did not comment on Meta’s potential shift away from Behemoth. If that happens so that Meta can prioritize closed-source models, it would mark a major philosophical change for the company.\nWhile Meta deploys more advanced closed-source models internally, like those powering its Meta AI assistant, Zuckerberg had made\nopen source\na central part of the company’s external AI strategy — a way to keep AI development moving faster. He loudly positioned the\nLlama family’s\nopenness as a differentiator from competitors like OpenAI, which Zuckerberg\npublicly criticized\nfor becoming more closed after partnering with Microsoft. But Meta is under pressure to monetize beyond ads as it pours billions into AI.\nThat includes paying massive signing bonuses and nine-figure salaries to poach top researchers, building out new data centers, and covering the enormous costs of developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), or “superintelligence.”\nTechcrunch event\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Past comments from Zuckerberg hint at an ambivalence toward committing to open sourcing Meta’s models. On a\npodcast\nlast summer, he said:\nWe’re obviously very pro open source, but I haven’t committed to releasing every single thing that we do. I’m basically very inclined to think that open sourcing is going to be good for the community and also good for us because we’ll benefit from the innovations. If at some point, however, there’s some qualitative change in what the thing is capable of, and we feel like it’s not responsible to open source it, then we won’t. It’s all very difficult to predict.\nClosed models would give Meta more control and more ways to monetize — especially if it believes the talent it has acquired can deliver competitive, best-in-class performance.\nSuch a shift could also reshape the AI landscape. Open source momentum, largely driven by Meta and models like Llama, could slow, even as OpenAI gears up to release its\nstill-delayed open model\n. Power could swing back toward the major players with closed ecosystems, while open source development might remain a product of grassroots efforts. The ripple effects would continue across the startup ecosystem, especially for smaller companies focused on fine-turning, safety, and model alignment that rely on access to open foundation models.\nOn the world stage, Meta’s retreat from open source could potentially cede ground to China, which has embraced open source AI — like DeepSeek and\nMoonshot AI\n— as a way to build domestic capability and global influence.\nTopics\nAI\n,\nAI\n,\nLlama\n,\nMeta\n,\nopen source ai\nRebecca Bellan\nSenior Reporter\nRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.
