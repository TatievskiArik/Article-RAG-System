It was last updated on 27 January 2025\nEurope's second largest country, Ukraine is a land of wide, fertile agricultural plains, with large pockets of heavy industry in the east.\nWhile Ukraine and Russia share common historical origins, the west of the country has closer ties with its European neighbours, particularly Poland, and nationalist sentiment has been strongest there.\nUkraine gained independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and then veered between seeking closer integration with Western Europe and being drawn into the orbit of Russia, which sees its interests as threatened by a Western-leaning Ukraine.\nAn uprising against pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014 ushered in a series of Western-leaning governments.\nThat same year, Russia seized the Crimean peninsula and armed insurgent groups to occupy parts of the east. The Russian army eventually launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022.\nSome estimates suggest that up to a million Russian and Ukrainians have been killed or injured in the first two and half years of fighting.\nRead more\ncountry profiles\n,\nexternal\n- Profiles by\nBBC Monitoring\n,\nexternal\nREPUBLIC OF UKRAINE: FACTS\nCapital:\nKyiv\nArea:\n603,550 sq km\nPopulation:\n33.4 million\nLanguage:\nUkrainian\nLife expectancy:\n68 years (men) 77 years (women)\nLEADERS\nPresident: Volodymyr Zelensky\nImage source,\nGetty Images\nMr Zelensky's initial claim to fame was playing a fictional president in a television comedy programme, and his victorious election campaign echoed his character's anti-establishment stance.\nHis Servant of the People party went on to win early parliamentary elections in July 2019, giving him control of both the executive and the legislature.\nPresident Zelensky went on to rally Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion in 2022.
