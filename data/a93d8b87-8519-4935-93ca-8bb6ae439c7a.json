This transformation—made possible by a combination of shrewd entrepreneurship, access to water, an extensive transportation network, and permissive state laws—has created the city now often known simply as “Vegas,” a place of vast casinos, elaborate hotels, and spectacular entertainment\nvenues\nthat attracts masses of visitors from throughout the world.\nLas Vegas: welcome sign\nThe welcome sign of Las Vegas.\nLas Vegas is Nevada’s economic centre and largest city. Its\nmetropolitan area\n, with more than twice the number of people outside the city limits as within them, contains roughly three-fourths of the state’s population. Area 83 square miles (215 square km). Pop. (2010) 583,756; Las Vegas–Paradise Metro Area, 1,951,269; (2020) 641,903; Las Vegas–Henderson Metro Area, 2,265,461.\nCharacter of the city\nParis Las Vegas Hotel and Casino\nA replica of the Eiffel Tower at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino.\nLas Vegas is a place of million-lightbulb signs and fantastic architecture, of readily visible wealth and carefully hidden poverty. It is a place of superlatives, both positive and negative. Within the city stand the largest glass pyramid in the world; one of the largest hotels in the country, with more than 5,000 rooms; and one of the most expensive hotels ever constructed, the Bellagio. The area along Las Vegas Boulevard and its adjoining near-downtown streets—the famous “Strip”—is the “City Without Clocks,” whose multibillion-dollar economy is devoted to servicing a wide\narray\nof impulses and addictions of many kinds. It is this Las Vegas, the flashy playground unofficially known as “Sin City,” that the American novelist and essayist\nJoan Didion\nonce termed\nthe most extreme and allegorical of American settlements, bizarre and beautiful in its venality and in its devotion to immediate gratification.\nDowntown Las Vegas is built to serve not residents but guests—tens of millions annually. Once derided as a cultural backwater, Las Vegas has evolved into an economic power that outstrips the output of whole countries. It is one of the country’s leading vacation destinations, drawing far more tourists than the\nGrand Canyon\nor\nYellowstone National Park\n.\nSuburban housing in Las Vegas\nThe suburbs of Las Vegas, Nevada.\nBeyond the bright lights of the Strip, however, lies a perfectly ordinary Western city, with neighborhoods, churches, shopping centers, and strip malls. It is that city, and not the hotels and casinos, that draws thousands of new residents each year. This growth, coupled with its unusual economic basis, has made Las Vegas one of the wealthiest cities in the country, but it has also brought problems to the area. Las Vegas is among the country’s leaders in personal and property crimes, as well as suicide rates,\nalcohol consumption\n, and illegal\ndrug use\n. The city also suffers the modern urban ills of air and\nwater pollution\n, and the roads are choked with increasingly heavy traffic as new\nsuburbs\nspring up in all directions.\nLandscape\nCity site\n1 of 2\nNevada: Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area\nThe desert landscape of Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, near Las Vegas.\n2 of 2\nNevada\nLas Vegas lies at the bottom of the state of Nevada.\nLas Vegas’s historic core lies at a site once occupied by marshes, freshwater springs, and grassy meadows (hence the city’s name;\nvegas\nis Spanish for “meadows”), long since covered by streets, buildings, and parking lots. The modern-day city sprawls across a broad, arid valley at an elevation of roughly 2,000 feet (610 meters). The valley fans out eastward from the picturesque, pine-clad\nSpring Mountains, whose highest point,\nCharleston Peak, rises above 11,910 feet (3,630 meters). To the north lie three lower ranges, the Pintwater, Spotted, and Desert mountains, and to the east are the McCullough and Sheep ranges. A wide pass between those two ranges leads to\nHoover Dam\nand\nLake Mead\n, the huge\nreservoir\non the\nColorado River\nimpounded by the dam; Las Vegas Wash, the valley’s major drainage, leads through this route.\nGet Unlimited Access\nTry Britannica Premium for free and discover more.\nSubscribe\nSurrounded by mountains, the Las Vegas Valley is a basin that collects the scant rainwater and snowmelt that reach it. Underlying that basin is a series of aquifers that once led out into small springs near the site of what is now the downtown area. These springs, most of which have dried up because of excessive\ngroundwater\npumping, historically flowed into the Colorado River toward the\nPacific Ocean\n. The southern limit of the\nGreat Basin\nreaches to just 15 miles (24 km) north of Las Vegas; its waters, which have no outlet to the sea, disappear into a vast inland desert.\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nThe city lies geographically close to the bottom edge of Nevada.\nThe Las Vegas Valley is ecologically part of the\nMojave Desert\n, whose characteristic plant is the Joshua tree. The smallest of the North American deserts, the Mojave supports significant human settlement only in the Las Vegas area and at a few points along the\nColorado River\n. More than four-fifths of the city’s\nwater supply\ncomes from the Colorado River at Lake Mead. The remainder is pumped from underground aquifers. As more water has been removed from these aquifers, the sandy soils have subsided, leading to\nfissuring\nand structural damage of the surface and the formation of large sinkholes. These\nfissures\nare\ncompounded\nby the damage caused by occasional earthquakes; the Las Vegas Valley, particularly its northwest quadrant, lies in an active fault zone."
