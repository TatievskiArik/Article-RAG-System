The choice of Madrid, however, was also the result of the city’s previous obscurity and neutrality: it was chosen because it lacked ties with an established nonroyal power rather than because of any strategic, geographic, or economic considerations. Indeed, Madrid is deficient in other characteristics that might qualify it for a leading role. It does not lie on a major river, as so many European cities do; the 16th–17th-century dramatist\nLope de Vega\n, referring to a magnificent bridge over the distinctly unimposing waters of the Manzanares, suggested either selling the bridge or buying another river. Madrid does not possess mineral deposits or other natural wealth, nor was it ever a destination of\npilgrimages\n, although its\npatron saint\n, San Isidro, enjoys the all-but-unique distinction of having been married to another saint. Even the city’s origins seem inappropriate for a national capital: its earliest historical role was as the site of a small Moorish fortress on a rocky outcrop—part of the northern defenses of what was then the far more important city of\nToledo\n, located about 43 miles (70 km) south-southwest.\nPuerta de Alcalá\nThe Puerta de Alcalá on the Plaza de la Independencia, Madrid, Spain.\nMadrid was officially made the national capital by\nPhilip III\n, an entire generation after Philip II took the court to Madrid in 1561. Under the patronage of Philip II and his successors, Madrid developed into a city of curious contrasts, preserving its old, overcrowded centre, around which developed palaces, convents, churches, and public buildings. Pop. (2011) 3,198,645; (2018 est.) 3,223,334.\nPhysical and human geography\nThe landscape\nThe city site and climate\nMadrid lies almost exactly at the geographical heart of the\nIberian Peninsula\n. It is situated on an undulating\nplateau\nof sand and clay known as the\nMeseta\n(derived from the Spanish word\nmesa\n, “table”) at an elevation of some 2,120 feet (646 metres) above\nsea level\n, making it one of the highest capitals in\nEurope\n. This location, together with the proximity of the Sierra de Guadarrama, is partly responsible for the weather pattern of cold, crisp winters accompanied by sharp winds. Sudden variations of temperature are possible, but summers are consistently dry and hot, becoming especially oppressive in July and August, when temperatures sometimes rise above 100 °F (38 °C). Average temperatures range between 41 and 75 °F (5 and 24 °C), while average\nprecipitation\nvaries between a low of less than 0.5 inch (11 mm) in July up to about 2 inches (50 mm) in October, usually the rainiest month of the year. The\ntemperate\ntimes of year are spring and fall, which are also the most attractive seasons for visitors.\nThe city layout\nwrought iron balconies in Madrid\nWrought iron balconies on a building in Madrid.\nMadrid is a city of contrasting styles, reflecting clearly the different periods in which change and development took place. The old centre, a maze of small streets around a few squares in the vicinity of the imposing Plaza Mayor, contrasts with the stately Neoclassical buildings and grand boulevards created by the most eminent architects of their day. Modern office buildings in the centre and swaths of apartment blocks around the outskirts attest to the styles and economic realities of present-day development.\nMadrid: Philip IV statue\nEquestrian statue of Philip IV in the Plaza de Oriente, Madrid.\nMuch of Madrid gives the impression of being cramped. When Madrid was first made the capital, the king obliged the city’s inhabitants to let a floor of their houses to ambassadors and visiting dignitaries, which prompted many people to build structures with only one floor or sometimes (in the so-called\ncasas a la malicia\n, or “spite houses”) with two floors but with a facade giving the impression of only one. Subsequent development of the city generated an enormous demand for land, particularly with the extensive\nconstruction\nof public buildings and convents. The last of Madrid’s four sets of city walls was built in 1625 and was not demolished until 1860 (by which time the population of the city had quadrupled). The situation was not\nalleviated\neven when\nNapoleon\n’s brother\nJoseph Bonaparte\n, who briefly interrupted the\nBourbon\nline of kings, demolished the convents to create more open space. Joseph’s nickname El Rey Plazuelas (“King of the Small Plazas”)—one of the few complimentary ones he was given—derived from the squares he created. They did little to appease the\necclesiastical\nauthorities, whose alienation contributed to his downfall. One of the squares, the\nPlaza de Oriente\n, facing the palace of the same name, was cleared of 56 houses, a library, a church, and several convents.\nRetiro Park\nThe equestrian statue of King Alfonso XII in Retiro Park, Madrid, Spain.\n“Los Madriles” (“the Madrids”) is a traditional phrase that acknowledges the fact that each\nbarrio\n(quarter) has developed its own style. There was also a geographical and social distinction among the geographically placed\nbarrios altos\n(upper quarters),\nbarrios centrales\n(middle quarters), and\nbarrios bajos\n(lower quarters). The last, spilling downhill from the Plaza Mayor along the Calle de Toledo toward the river, are still poor,\nalbeit\npicturesque. Later development, also accommodating Madrid’s poorer citizens, spread down toward the reclaimed marshland on both sides of the river, where low-cost housing can still be found. Construction of the Valdecarros district in the southeast of Madrid’s municipality, expected to house about 150,000 residents, began in 2007. Just over the brow of the hill is the Rastro, the popular\nflea market\n. Despite a number of urban development plans, Madrid did not spread into the open spaces around it, not even crossing the Manzanares River until 1948. By contrast, the city as a whole has some extensive parks, with more open space overall than\nParis\n. Some, like El Pardo or Casa de Campo, are survivals of hunting parks; the Retiro, on the other hand, is the site of a former royal palace.\nAccess for the whole family!\nBundle Britannica Premium and Kids for the ultimate resource destination.\nSubscribe\nMadrid has not escaped the problems common to so many modern cities. Pollution can be intense, and severe traffic congestion is common. Personal safety is not as certain as it once was in the days of the\nserenos\n(night watchmen). But the city has preserved the charm, character, and vivacity that give it and its inhabitants a style of their own—an important aspect of modern Spain, where each region seeks to express its own identity."
