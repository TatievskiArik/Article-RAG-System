Ariel was first established in 1978 and its population was 20,520 in 2022, composed of veteran and young Israelis, English-speaking immigrants, and immigrants from the\nformer Soviet Union\n, with an additional influx of above 10,000 students from\nAriel University\n.\n[\n2\n]\n[\n3\n]\nIt is the fourth largest Israeli settlement in the West Bank,\n[\n4\n]\nafter\nModi'in Illit\n,\nBeitar Illit\n, and\nMa'ale Adumim\n.\nThe\ninternational community\nconsiders Israeli settlements in the West Bank\nillegal under international law\n, but the Israeli government disputes this.\n[\n5\n]\nAriel's jurisdiction spans 14,677\ndunams\n(14.677 km\n2\n; 5.667 sq mi),\n[\n6\n]\nand borders the Palestinian towns and villages\nSalfit\n,\nMarda\nand\nIskaka\n. According to\nB'Tselem\n, within Ariel's municipal area there are several enclaves of privately owned Palestinian land, whose owners are not allowed access to them.\n[\n7\n]\nEtymology\nAriel (pronounced Ari'el), literally means 'Lion of God'. \"Ari\" (Lion) in Hebrew is also a synonym for bravery and courage and it is also the symbol of the\ntribe of Judah\n. The city of Ariel is named after\nJerusalem\n.\n[\n8\n]\nAriel in the\nHebrew Bible\nis one of the names for\nJerusalem\nand the\nTemple of Jerusalem\n(Isaiah 29:1–8).\nHistory\nAriel was founded in 1978 on land that was seized for military needs and on land that was declared state land, including cultivated farmland of Palestinian villages in the district and on rocky land the villagers used for grazing their flocks.\n[\n7\n]\nAt the beginning of 1978, a group of Israelis formed in order to create a settlement in the hills of the northern part of the West Bank made a formal request to the government to be given land to build a new community and were given three options by the army; the area near the 'lone tree' which would later become\nBarkan\n, the area which would later become\nKfar Tapuach\n, and a hill near\nKifl Hares\nthat was known to the local Arabs as 'Jabel Mawat', the hill of death, because of inhospitable terrain.\n[\n9\n]\nThe leader of this group,\nRon Nachman\n, chose the latter because of its strategic location on a possible Jordanian invasion route towards Israel's main population centre of Tel Aviv. In the spring of 1978, some of the group's men erected tents on the chosen hilltop, and in August 1978, a total of forty families came to live in the settlement.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nThe original members of the group had gone through a screening process in order to put together a mix of skilled adults as well as young families that would be prepared psychologically to withstand starting a new settlement from scratch with little infrastructure and modern comforts. There were no paved roads or paths. Water was supplied periodically by a tanker truck. Electricity was provided by a generator since no electrical network existed in that area. Tents were replaced by\nprefabricated\nconcrete blocks which served as living quarters, schools, and an infirmary. On September 1, 1978, the school year was officially opened.\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nFrom 1978 to 1988, Ariel continued to develop, and established itself as the urban center for the nearby Israeli settlements. In 1980, the prefabricated homes were replaced with permanent housing. The College of Judea and Samaria, which would later become the Ariel University Center of Samaria, and eventually\nAriel University\n, was founded in 1982. Three elementary schools, a community center, a sports hall, and a synagogue were built. In May 1982, Ariel was connected to the national power grid.\nDuring the\nmass immigration\nof Jews from\nSoviet Union\nthat began in 1989 and continued throughout the 1990s, Ariel, which had a population of 8,000 in 1990, experienced a population boom. Unlike in Israel proper, apartments in Ariel were plentiful and cheap, which proved attractive to the immigrants.\n[\n10\n]\nSome 6,000 Soviet immigrants moved to Ariel, almost doubling its population.\nIn 2005, the residents of\nNetzarim\n, a former Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip which had been\nevacuated\n, found temporary housing in the dormitories of the Ariel University Center of Samaria. At the beginning of the academic year, about one-third chose to settle permanently in Ariel, while the rest moved to\nYevul\n. In 2007, the city began receiving immigrants from English-speaking countries such as the\nUnited States\n,\nUnited Kingdom\n,\nCanada\n, and\nSouth Africa\nin significant numbers.\nNachman, a central figure in the\nLikud\nparty, presided over Ariel from 1978 until his death in January 2013, at first as head of the local council and as mayor from 1985, when the settlement was officially recognized as a city.\n[\n11\n]\nBoth religious and secular Jews reside in Ariel. The city has sixteen synagogues.\nOn 15 November 2022, three Israelis were murdered during a\nterror attack\nnear Ariel.\nGeography\nA neighborhood in Ariel\nAriel University\nORT\nEducational Center\nYovaley-Ariel\nStudents dormitory of University Center\nAriel is situated between 17 kilometres (11 mi) and 22 kilometres (14 mi) east of the\nGreen Line\n,\n[\n12\n]\n[\n13\n]\nand 34 kilometres (21 mi) west of the\nJordan River\n,\nJordan\n's western border. Ariel is adjacent to the\nPalestinian Authority\ntown of\nSalfit\nand southwest of\nNablus\n. It is approximately 30 kilometres (19 mi) east of\nPetah Tikva\n, and 42 kilometres (26 mi) east of Tel Aviv to which it is connected by the\nHighway 5\nand 60 kilometres (37 mi) northwest of\nJerusalem\n, to which it is connected by\nHighway 60\n.\nAriel's jurisdiction spans 14,677\ndunams\n(14.677 km\n2\n; 5.667 sq mi),\n[\n6\n]\nand borders the Palestinian towns and villages\nSalfit\n,\nMarda\nand\nIskaka\n. Ariel's municipal area contains several enclaves of privately owned Palestinian land, whose owners are not allowed access to them.\n[\n7\n]\nThe central water pumping station in Salfit has been polluted several times by overflow from the wastewater in Ariel.\n[\n7\n]\nEconomy\nThe city has several shopping centres and  two industrial zones (divided into light and heavy industry), a\nlibrary\n. In July 2008, Israel approved the construction of 27 new factories, which were expected to be completed by September 2009.\n[\n14\n]\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict\nStatus under international law\nLike all Israeli settlements in the\nIsraeli-occupied territories\n, Ariel is considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\n[\n15\n]\nA series of Israeli governments has insisted that Ariel be included within Israel's future borders under any future peace treaty.\n[\n16\n]\nThe\nIsraeli Ministry of the Interior\ngave the municipality of Ariel the status of a\ncity council\nin 1998. In January 2010,\nPrime Minister\nBenjamin Netanyahu\n, accompanied by leading figures in his governing coalition, declared Ariel the \"capital of\nSamaria\n\", and \"an integral part of Israel\".\n[\n4\n]\nIn December 2010, thirty-five MKs petitioned the government to annex Ariel to Israel.\n[\n17\n]\nPalestinian representatives have opposed the incorporation of Ariel into Israel in any future settlement, arguing that the Ariel 'finger' would interrupt the territorial integrity of a Palestinian state and includes a major\naquifer\n.  Ariel's future is thus not clear: \"as well as an obstacle to an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, it could also serve as a crucial trade-off for negotiators hammering out a final deal.\"\n[\n16\n]\nMcDonald's Israel\n, the local subsidiary of the international fast food chain, turned down an offer to open a restaurant in Ariel in June 2013, citing its declared policy not to open any branches in West Bank settlements across the Green Line.\n[\n18\n]\nWest Bank barrier\nThe\nIsraeli West Bank barrier\nwas originally planned to extend out from the Israeli border to Ariel. Under American political pressure, the \"finger\", as the extension of the fence to include Ariel is often called, was not built. Instead, Ariel has a security fence surrounding it on only three sides.\n[\n19\n]\nFirst Intifada\nIn mid-1989, during the\nFirst Intifada\n, the settlement came under controversy after the mayor ordered all Palestinians working in the settlement to wear visible badges identifying them as \"foreign workers.\" The order was criticised across the political spectrum in Israel, including Likud MK\nEhud Olmert\nwho called it \"insensitive and unwise\" and\nRatz\nMK\nYossi Sarid\nwho said he was \"disgusted,\" with some commentators comparing the order to the\nyellow badges\nimposed by Nazi Germany on Jews.\n[\n20\n]\n[\n21\n]\nThe settlement's mayor criticised the comparisons to Nazi Germany, saying that \"only a warped mind, ignorance and stupidity\" could compare the situation to \"the security needs of every settlement in Judea, Samaria and Israel.\" However, the settlement subsequently reversed the order.\n[\n22\n]\nEducation and culture\nAriel is home to the\nAriel University\n, founded in 1982 as the College of Judea and Samaria. In 2010, the university had a student population of 11,500, both\nIsraeli\nand\nPalestinian\n.\n[\n23\n]\nIn 2007, it changed its name to Ariel University Center of Samaria, a change that was officially recognized in 2010. In 2012, it received accreditation as a research university.\n[\n24\n]\nThe state-funded\nAriel Center for the Performing Arts\nopened on November 8, 2010, with a performance of\nPiaf\nby the\nBeersheba Theater\ncompany.\n[\n25\n]\nThese performances were\nboycotted\nby sixty Israeli actors, writers, and directors, including\nJoshua Sobol\n, who refuse to perform in settlements. Prime Minister\nBenjamin Netanyahu\n, Culture Minister\nLimor Livnat\nand the leader of the\nKadima Party\nTzipi Livni\ncondemned the boycott and proposed cutting government funding those participating in it.\n[\n26\n]\n[\n27\n]\nThe boycott was supported by 150 academics including\nAmos Oz\n,\nDavid Grossman\nand\nA. B. Yehoshua\n,\n[\n28\n]\n[\n29\n]\nIt was opposed by\nAmnon Shamosh\n, who suggested that the boycott plays into the hands of right-wing extremists by linking art and politics.\n[\n30\n]\n150 U.S. actors supported the boycott.\n[\n31\n]\nHowever, five Israeli actors later withdrew from the boycott, indicating that they changed their mind or thought the letter they were signing called for a discussion on the issue rather than outright boycott.\n[\n32\n]\nInternational relations\nSee also:\nList of twin towns and sister cities in Israel\nTwin towns/ Sister cities\nAriel is\ntwinned\nwith:\nHeredia, Costa Rica\n[\n33\n]\nMobile, Alabama\n,\nUnited States\n[\n33\n]\n[\n34\n]\nCeadîr-Lunga\n,\nMoldova\nDivjakë\n,\nAlbania\nReferences\n^\n\"Regional Statistics\"\n.\nIsrael Central Bureau of Statistics\n.
