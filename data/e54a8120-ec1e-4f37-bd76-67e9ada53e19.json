Tel Aviv maintains its attraction as the main economic, cultural and educational hub of the country which is home to major businesses. Located on the Mediterranean coast, the city was founded in 1909 as part of the ancient city port of Jaffa (Yafo). It is situated approximately 60 km far from the Israeli capital, Jerusalem which is considered as the holy land of three monotheistic religions; Islam, Christianity and Judaism. The metropolitan area of Tel Aviv offers a multicultural and vivid environment that is worth visiting throughout the year due to its mild Mediterranean climate accompanied by glorious beaches. Furthermore, its rich cultural background is marked by a wide range of sites worth to visit; Tel Aviv has one of the world heritage sites renowned for its Bauhaus architectural landmarks with its highly appealing ‘White City’. Tel Aviv welcomes visitors with its rich culinary tradition and active nightlife as well. It is within\n12 km\ndistance to\nPetah Tikva,\n13 km\nto Rishon LeZion,\n30 km\nto\nAshdod,\n54 km\nto Jerusalem.\nGeneral Information\nCountry:\nIsrael\nRegion:\nMiddle East\nArea:\n52 km²\nLanguage:\nHebrew\nAverage temperature:\n26 °C\nClimate:\nMediterranean\nVegetation:\nMaquis\nThe difference between GMT:\nGMT +3\nTelephone Code:\n+972\nCurrency:\nIsraeli New Shekel\nSocket Type:\nType C and H\nHow to Get to Tel Aviv\nTel Aviv is within a short distance from Turkey and easily reached with affordable\nflight tickets\noffered by Pegasus Airlines. There are direct flights from Istanbul and occasionally from Antalya. It only takes 1 hour 35 minutes from Antalya and 2 hours and 10 minutes from Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen Airport to Ben Gurion International Airport, which is the busiest airport in the country.\nSEARCH CHEAP FLIGHTS\nTransportation from Tel Aviv Airport to the City Center\nBen Gurion International Airport is located\nabout 45 km northwest of Jerusalem and 20 km to the southeast of Tel Aviv, in the middle of two main cities.  There are various options to reach Tel Aviv city-center. Taking a taxi is probably the fastest and most comfortable way, as it takes only 20 minutes. The taxi lines can be found immediately outside the arrivals hall on level G of Terminal 3. The prices for taxi rides are usually fixed with the opportunity of pre-booking online.\nBuses are among the most common means of transport in Israel and public transportation can be another option to get to the city center, though it appears to be a bit more complicated with less frequent schedules.\nTravelers should first take the shuttle bus Number 5 to the Airport City station, found at the exit 21 and 23 of Terminal 3 and then change to a city bus according to the desired destination in Tel Aviv.  Tickets can be purchased from the driver on the bus. Taking the train straight from Terminal 3 on level S is an alternative method that gets to the center in about 20 minutes, but particular attention should be paid to the timetables, since they don’t run on holidays or late at midnight.\nTravelers may also opt for benefiting from Pegasus Airlines’\ncar rental services\n. Passengers can easily utilize the online platform to organize their journey by typing in city or airport name to manage their bookings beforehand. Making your trip flexible and reliable, a great range of transfer options will be offered suited to your needs and preferences.\nRENT A CAR\nPublic Transport in Tel Aviv\nThe best way to get around in Tel Aviv is on foot, since it is well connected within short distances. But there are various transportation options ranging from buses, trains, shared taxis, bike rentals and electric scooters for those we would like to consume less energy.\nRav Kav is the public transportation pass in Israel, that enables passengers to install the required credits ahead of the journey for the use of all public means of transportation, except for shared cabs. The Rav Kav card can be purchased at the airport or the central train station. There is also the Rav Kav mobile application, that makes online payment option possible. All the necessary information relating to fares, routes and timetables can be accessed on the\nwebsite\nof main bus operator company, Dan\n.\nFurthermore, there are more environment friendly options provided by e-bike rentals services, such as\nPole Position\nand\nO-Fun\n, that call for a fun ride along the coast.\nBest Time to Visit Tel Aviv\nTel Aviv has a warm Mediterranean climate characterized by warm dry summers and mild wet winters. It is known to be a sunny tourist destination with an average of 3300 hours of sunshine yearly. On average, the warmest month is August while the coolest one appears to be January that is accompanied with lots of rain.\nThe city is often loaded with many tourists, especially during the long summer days of July and August. Hence, the off-season might seem as a better period to enjoy the city to the fullest. On the other hand, the high temperatures with soaring levels of humidity in summer time draws immense attraction to the fantastic beaches. Yet, the best time to visit Tel Aviv is probably spring and fall, in which travelers can still enjoy the fairly cooler temperatures while freshening up in the sea. Since the name of the city itself means ‘Hill of Spring’, the blooming season might as well be a joyful time to discover all the beauty the city has to offer.  Sparing at least a week in Tel Aviv to get the real feel of vibrant city life is highly recommended.\nFestivals in Tel Aviv\nTel Aviv is the host of a growing number of festivals each year, that keeps attracting many people from different interest groups.\n“White Night Festival” organized by the Municipality of Tel Aviv-Jaffa (June-July)\n“Docaviv,” the city’s International Documentary Film Festival (May)\n“DLD”, Israel’s largest hi-tech conference (mid-September)\n“Tel Aviv Eat”, the city food festival to experience the culinary world of Israel (usually held in May)\nPlaces to Visit in Tel Aviv\nTel Aviv never ceases to amaze its visitors with its golden beaches, world-class museums, vivid neighborhoods, savory restaurants and shopping hubs.\nThe city has just so many things to offer even if you are just taking a stroll outdoors.
