One of the most highly anticipated\nsessions happening on one of the two AI Stages\nwill spotlight where AI hardware is heading next, featuring a live look at the robotics and autonomous systems pushing boundaries in real time.\nIn this session, two of the field’s most visionary builders, Raquel Urtasun and Jeff Cardenas, will take the stage to explore the current and future state of AI hardware. They will unpack how it’s enabling new applications across humanoid robotics and autonomous vehicles. Expect deep technical insight, and a look at what it takes to move advanced simulation and embodied intelligence from concept to real-world deployment.\nBuilding the future, piece by piece\nJeff Cardenas\nis the co-founder and CEO of\nApptronik\n, a human-centered robotics company developing some of the world’s most advanced humanoid robots. Focused on designing machines that safely and intelligently work alongside people, Cardenas has guided Apptronik through key partnerships with companies like Google DeepMind, Nvidia, and Mercedes-Benz. His mission is clear: make robotics practical, capable, and commercially viable.\nRaquel Urtasun\n, founder and CEO of\nWaabi\n, is one of the most respected voices in self-driving technology. As a decorated researcher and entrepreneur, she is building a new generation of autonomous vehicle systems grounded in simulation and AI. Her work has earned recognition from TIME, Business Insider, and the Royal Society of Canada, and her company is setting new benchmarks in scalable, intelligent AV platforms.\nWhy this session matters\nAI hardware is no longer just a technical foundation — it is the interface between intelligence and action. Whether it’s robots that can operate in human environments or autonomous systems navigating real-world complexity, the next phase of AI will depend on hardware that can think, sense, and perform. This session will examine the progress, the challenges, and the breakthroughs that are shaping this frontier.\nCatch Raquel Urtasun and Jeff Cardenas on the AI Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27 to 29 at Moscone West in San Francisco.\nRegister now\nto join more than 10,000 startup and VC leaders and\nsave up to $675\nbefore prices increase.\nTopics\nAI\n,\nDisrupt 2025\n,\nRobotics\n,\nStartups\n,\nTC\n,\nTechCrunch Disrupt\n,\nTechCrunch Disrupt 2025\nTechCrunch Events\nView Bio\nOctober 27-29, 2025\nSan Francisco\nPut your brand in front of 10,000+ tech and VC leaders across all three days of Disrupt 2025.
