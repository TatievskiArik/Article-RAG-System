Think again – they’re actually slowing developers down | IT Pro\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\nBy\nNicole Kobie\npublished\n23 July 2025\nin\nNews\nAI might actually be slowing down software developers, new research suggests, despite their own positive predictions that AI coding tools will help their work.\nModel Evaluation & Threat Research (METR) ran a randomized, controlled trial to\nstudy\nthe use of early-2025\nAI tools\nused by experienced developers working on their own open source repositories.\nThe results weren't positive, with the\nstudy\nfinding that developers take 19% longer on average when using\nAI tools\n.\nThat said, METR noted this is a single snapshot of AI capabilities in a single setting — results may vary, METR's essentially saying — and the company hopes to use the figures as a baseline to track and estimate AI acceleration and adoption.\nExperienced developers aren’t seeing benefits\nMETR's study used 16 developers with at least five years of experience who provided a list of 246 issues, such as bug fixes or wished-for features, that would make up their real day-to-day work. The developers in the study largely used Cursor Pro and Claude Sonnet.\n\"When developers are allowed to use AI tools, they take 19% longer to complete issues—a significant slowdown that goes against developer beliefs and expert forecasts,\" the post noted.\n\"This gap between perception and reality is striking: developers expected AI to speed them up by 24%, and even after experiencing the slowdown, they still believed AI had sped them up by 20%.\"\nGet the ITPro daily newsletter\nSign up today and you will receive a free copy of our Future Focus 2025 report - the leading guidance on AI, cybersecurity and other IT challenges as per 700+ senior executives\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands\nReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nThe METR team listed a few factors they believe likely contributed to the slowdown — the first of which was simply being over-optimistic about the usefulness of AI.\nBeyond that, the study showed developers accepted fewer than 44% of AI generated code, with most of those taking part in the study saying they had to make major changes to clean up code. All told, roughly 9% of their time was spent reviewing or cleaning AI output.\nDevelopers reported that AI appeared to struggle in large, complex environments, while the human coders themselves had so much experience in their areas of expertise that the\nAI\ncouldn't keep up, an issue exacerbated by the fact that it \"doesn't utilize important tacit knowledge or context.\"\nThe researchers also spotted a few potential causes for the AI slowdown, though they stressed the impact was unclear. That included developers using the AI to experiment and waiting on AI to generate code.\nThe researchers stressed that the results don't mean that AI is never useful. \"Furthermore, these results do not imply that future models will not speed up developers in this exact setting — this is a salient possibility given the rapid pace of progress in AI capabilities recently,\" the\npaper\nsaid.\n\"Finally, it remains possible that further improvements to current AI systems (e.g. better prompting/agent scaffolding, or domain-specific finetuning) could yield positive speed up in this setting.\"\nDoes AI help or hinder?\nStudying real-world impact is necessary, METR said, as AI benchmarks are often unrealistic or can't be easily applied to real-world tasks.\n\"While coding/agentic benchmarks have proven useful for understanding AI capabilities, they typically sacrifice realism for scale and efficiency—the tasks are self-contained, don’t require prior context to understand, and use algorithmic evaluation that doesn’t capture many important capabilities,\" the post noted.\n\"These properties may lead benchmarks to overestimate AI capabilities.\"\nThe METR study follows\nresearch by Atlassian\nthat suggested AI tools are saving 86% of developers a full day of work each week, letting them focus on improving code quality or creating new features.\nHowever, half of those surveyed said they are losing that AI-gained time because of \"organisational inefficiencies\" — essentially, bad management is eating up any savings.\n\"This pressure-cooked mix of innovation and strain demands a closer look at how AI is reshaping the developer experience, and what that means for the future of software development across the industry,” said Atlassian CTO Rajeev Rajan.\nMake sure to follow\nITPro on Google News\nto keep tabs on all our latest news, analysis, and reviews.\nMORE FROM ITPRO\nCEOs think workers are becoming hostile to AI tools, but they’re pushing ahead with adoption anyway\nAI coding tools are finally delivering results for enterprises\nBig tech promised developers productivity gains with AI tools – now they’re being rendered obsolete\nTOPICS\nNicole Kobie\nFreelance journalist Nicole Kobie first started writing for ITPro in 2007, with bylines in New Scientist, Wired, PC Pro and many more.\nNicole the author of a book about the history of technology, The Long History of the Future.\nLatest\nNew chapter, same partners: Keeping the channel aligned with change\nIndustry Insights\nHow to maintain strong channel partnerships amid evolving strategies and market change\nPalo Alto Networks snaps up CyberArk in identity security push\nNews\nThe acquisition marks the latest in a string for Palo Alto Networks\nYou might also like\n84% of software developers are now using AI, but nearly half 'don't trust' the technology over accuracy concerns\nNews\nAI coding tools are delivering benefits for developers, but they’re still worried about security and compliance\nOpenAI's plan to acquire AI coding startup Windsurf ended in disaster – here’s how the deal fell apart\nNews\nThe acquisition by Cognition comes after a rumored $3bn offer from OpenAI fell through\nAtlassian says AI has created an 'unexpected paradox' for software developers – they're saving over 10 hours a week, but they’re still overworked and losing an equal amount of time due to ‘organizational inefficiencies’\nNews\nWhile AI is helping save developers over 10 hours a week, these productivity boosts are being offset by growing workloads and poor operational efficiency, Atlassian says.\nAI coding tools are booming – and developers in this one country are by far the most frequent users\nNews\nAI coding tools are soaring in popularity worldwide, but developers in one particular country are among the most frequent users.\nGitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke thinks there’s still a place for junior developers in the age of AI\nNews\nGitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke believes junior developers still play a crucial role in the hierarchy of software development teams, and AI won't change that any time soon.\nMCP servers used by developers and 'vibe coders' are riddled with vulnerabilities – here’s what you need to know\nNews\nSecurity researchers have issued a warning over rampant vulnerabilities found in MCP servers used by developers and 'vibe coders'.\nMistral targets security-conscious developers with new AI coding assistant\nThe coding assistant, available now in private preview, will be fully customizable\nBig tech promised developers productivity gains with AI tools – now they’re being rendered obsolete\nOpinion\nBig tech promised software developers huge benefits with AI tools, but now they face job cuts as companies ramp up automation.\nView More ▸"
